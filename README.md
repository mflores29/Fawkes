**-What experience do you have building websites?**
     My experience with building websites is very limited. I have been exposed to the background creative processes and to the amount of work that goes in to developing a website on various occasions, but have never had to do this work or tasks firsthand. However, I am very much so technologically inclined in every aspect of my life and it is something that I am passionate about. I find a natural rhythm when applying my current knowledge to learn a new skill that is a part of our technological ecosystem. Learning to build a website has always been a skill that I have wanted to educate myself on and add to my toolbox in order to become a more resourceful individual and employee in the future.
 
**-What software experience do you currently have?**
     Currently my strongest software knowledge lies within the OS X environment. I am a previous Apple employee and used to conduct one-on-one training sessions and workshops to develop the skill set of our customers in using OS X and iOS. I would train them on how to properly utilize the iLife and iWork suites as well as any software related to their mobile devices. Those suites include programs such as iMovie, GarageBand, iPhoto, Pages, Keynote, and Numbers. Apart from that I have become versed in Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Final Cut. I would say that my knowledge of those are of an amateur level, but developing quickly because I use them more regularly now in both my personal and professional life. I am also very familiar with the Windows environment and the Office Suite used by most businesses. 
 
**-What are some of your strongest soft skills (read this)?**
     I believe that my strongest soft skill would be the ability to empathize really well with people. In any situation I am able to fully listen to their issues and assure them that I understand by aligning with their thought process. From there I can assure them that steps will be made that will allow them to feel better about whatever they initially had issues with. I use this skill heavily in both personal and professional settings, it has truly helped me develop and maintain healthy relationships all over. Just to list some other soft skills I would have to say teamwork, motivation, flexibility, time management, creative thinking, and conflict resolution. 

**-Where do you see yourself working after you complete your studies?**
     I don't know exactly which specific field that I want to dedicate my life to completely just yet. I do know that I see myself working with various types of media all in one project. I truly enjoy creating content using various mediums. From photography and video to podcasts and creative writing. I see myself pursuing a career where I can combine all of those interests in to one big project that will be used to benefit people in some way. I know that whatever I decide on I want the outcome to be content that will bring information and joy to someone's life in a positive way.
